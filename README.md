### **Overview of the BTC/USD Trading Bot**

The BTC/USD trading bot is designed to autonomously manage trading activities in the cryptocurrency market, specifically focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) against the US Dollar (USD). It incorporates a set of advanced risk management strategies, market analysis techniques, and capital protection mechanisms to ensure optimal trading decisions while minimizing risks. Below are the key features and functionalities:

### **Key Features**

1. **Dynamic Position Sizing**:
   - The bot calculates the appropriate position size based on a defined risk percentage of the starting capital (e.g., 2% of account balance per trade).
   - It uses the Average True Range (ATR) to adjust lot sizes, considering market volatility, ensuring trades are sized appropriately for the current market conditions.

2. **Capital Protection**:
   - A **minimum capital protection** mechanism ensures that trading does not proceed if the account balance falls below a defined protection threshold (e.g., $10). This prevents further trades when funds are too low, safeguarding the core capital.

3. **Trade Risk Management**:
   - **Risk Percentage**: The bot risks a fixed percentage of the account balance per trade (e.g., 2%).
   - **Trailing Stops and Take-Profit**: The bot uses a trailing stop based on a multiplier of ATR for dynamic stop placement. It also sets take-profit levels based on the ATR to capture market gains effectively.
   - **Stop-Loss**: It ensures that every trade has a stop-loss set at a minimum distance (e.g., 20 points).

4. **Market Indicators**:
   - The bot utilizes several technical indicators for market analysis:
     - **Moving Averages (MA)**: It uses fast and slow moving averages to identify potential buy and sell signals.
     - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Used to gauge whether the market is overbought (above 75) or oversold (below 25), helping the bot avoid entering trades in unfavorable market conditions.
     - **ADX (Average Directional Index)**: This measures the strength of the market trend. Trades are only initiated when the trend is strong (ADX > 20).
     - **ATR (Average True Range)**: ATR is used for volatility-based position sizing, stop-loss, and take-profit calculations.
   
5. **Crash Protection**:
   - **High Volatility Detection**: If the ATR exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 100), the bot stops opening new trades to prevent entering during extreme volatility.
   - **Emergency Exit**: In the event of extreme market crashes (e.g., if the ATR exceeds 150 or the price drops by more than 2% within 5 minutes), the bot immediately closes all open trades to prevent further losses.

6. **Time-Based Exit Strategy**:
   - **Max Trade Duration**: The bot automatically closes trades after a set duration (e.g., 30 minutes) if they have not reached a favorable profit or have turned into a loss/breakeven.
   
7. **Cumulative Profit Target**:
   - The bot stops trading once it achieves a cumulative profit target (e.g., $20) to lock in gains and prevent overexposure.

8. **Margin Monitoring**:
   - The bot continuously monitors the account’s margin level. If free margin falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 20%), the bot stops opening new trades to prevent margin calls.

### **Trading Strategy**

- **Trend Following**: The bot follows a trend-based strategy using the combination of moving averages, RSI, and ADX. It opens a **buy** trade when the fast MA crosses above the slow MA, the RSI is below overbought levels, and the ADX confirms a strong trend. Similarly, it opens a **sell** trade when the fast MA crosses below the slow MA, the RSI is above oversold levels, and the ADX indicates a strong trend.
  
- **Volatility-Based Entry and Exit**: The bot uses the ATR to dynamically calculate take-profit and stop-loss levels, ensuring the trade adapts to the market's volatility. It also employs a trailing stop mechanism to lock in profits as the market moves in favor of the trade.

- **Capital Preservation**: The bot incorporates the minimum capital protection rule to avoid trading when the account balance is below a certain level. This helps to avoid unnecessary risks when the account is underfunded.

- **Emergency Exit**: The bot reacts to sudden market crashes by monitoring the ATR and price drop percentage. If these exceed predefined thresholds, it closes all open positions to prevent further losses.

### **Performance Goals**

- **Profit Target**: The bot aims for a **total profit target** of $20. Once this target is reached, the bot ceases trading, locking in the gains.
  
- **Risk Management**: The bot risks a fixed percentage of the account capital (e.g., 2%) per trade, ensuring that each trade’s potential loss is within a controlled limit.
